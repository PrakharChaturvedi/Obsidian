- Arun and his sister Usha are challenging each other with some mathematical puzzles. Usha, the cleverer one, has come up with the idea of giving Arun 12 distinct digits from 0 to 9, and have him form the largest date time in 2018 with them. Arun is a little nervous, and asks you to help him with a computer program.
- Usha will give Arun 12 distinct digits. He needs to create a date time combination in the year 2018: the date in the MM/DD form (all four digits must be present), and the time in the format HH: MM (all four digits must be present). The date may be from 01/01 to 12/31 and the time may be from 00:00 to 23:59 (in the 24 hour format). The digits provided may be used only once in the answer that Arun gives.
- If more than one date time combination may be formed, Arun needs to give the latest valid date time possible in the year 2018.
- Constraints : single digit 0 to 9

- Input Format: A line consisting of a sequence of 12 (not necessarily distinct) single digits (any of 0-9) separated by commas. The sequence will be non-decreasing.

- Output: The maximum possible valid date time in the year 2018. The output must be in the format MM/DD HH: MM If no date time can be constructed, the output should be 0.

Explanation: 
- Example1 : 
	- Input 0,0,1,2,2,2,3,5,9,9,9,9
    - Output : 12/30 22:59   
    - Explanation : The 12 digits to be used by Arun are given. The maximum valid date time using only the digits given, and with each digit used at most once is 12/30 22:59
- Example 2 :
	- Input : 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
	- Output : 0
    - Explanation : As no digit less than 3 is present in the input, a valid month cannot be formed. Hence no valid Date time can be formed with the input digits.
