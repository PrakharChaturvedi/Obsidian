	- Employee Self-Service Portal: Employees can manage their personal details, leave requests, and see their payroll details directly from the portal.
* **Workforce Planning \& Optimization:**
	- AI-based workforce scheduling that adapts to production demand, adjusting shifts dynamically to avoid under or overstaffing.
	- Labor Productivity Analysis: Track productivity metrics like units produced per employee or team, and identify areas for performance improvement.
* **Health \& Safety Compliance:**
	- Track compliance with workplace health and safety regulations (e.g., working hours, breaks, PPE).
	- Incident reporting system for accidents or near-misses, integrated with corrective action management.
* **Employee Training \& Certifications**:
	- Manage employee certifications for specialized machinery or tasks, with expiry notifications for renewals.
	- Skill Gap Analysis: Identify skills shortages and recommend training programs for employees.
***5. Payroll \& Salary Management***

	- Cross-Border Payroll: Handle the complexities of different salary structures, tax rates, and social security contributions for employees across various countries.
* **Payroll Compliance:**
	- Ensure compliance with local labor laws in each country (e.g., working hours, minimum wage, tax withholdings).
	- Generate reports for tax authorities and statutory bodies for each country, ensuring audit readiness.
* **Automated Payslip Generation:**
	- Generate and distribute digital payslips with easy-to-understand breakdowns for employees.
