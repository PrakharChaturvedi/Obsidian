### Job I can go for 
Consider searching and applying under titles such as:
- **Business/Systems Analyst** (often “IT Business Analyst” in tech firms)
- **Data/Business Intelligence Analyst** or **Data Analyst** (entry-level data roles)
- **Technology/IT Consultant** (including Technical Consultant or Solutions Consultant)
- **Associate/Analyst Consultant** (in management or IT consulting firms)
- **Operations or Strategy Analyst** (entry roles in strategy or operations teams)
- **Product Analyst or Product Data Analyst** (in tech/product companies)
- **Implementation or Solution Consultant** (for software/ERP vendors)
- **Risk/Financial Analyst** (in finance roles leveraging tech skills).

### Job-Hunting Strategies
- **Resume Tailoring:** 
	- Rewrite the resume summary and bullets to stress analytical and consulting-relevant skills. Highlight any project outcome or metrics (e.g. “improved app performance by X%” or “led team of 4”). 
	- Use bullet points (not paragraphs) and quantify achievements. 
	- Emphasize internships and leadership, as Deloitte advises that for campus hires, relevant internships and projects (even unpaid) are critical to “grow your resume”. 
	- Include coursework or certificates (e.g. “Data Analytics with Python”) in skills. Match language from job descriptions: if “stakeholder analysis” or “data visualization” is mentioned, ensure those keywords are in the resume.
- **LinkedIn Optimization:** 
	- Craft a clear headline/summary reflecting the pivot (e.g. “Computer Science Graduate seeking Data/Business Analyst roles”). Ensure your profile is 100% complete, listing all technical and soft skills. According to recruiters, LinkedIn uses keyword searches on profiles. 
	- Place high-value skills (e.g. SQL, Flutter, Analytics) in the headline and summary so recruiters see them. Mark your “Career Interests” for analyst/consulting fields to get LinkedIn job alerts. 
	- Follow and connect with people from target companies (alumni, former interns). Join relevant groups (e.g. data science India, consulting networks) to see job posts and engage in discussions.
- **Applying and Networking:** 
	- In addition to company career pages, use job portals (LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, Naukri.com, Glassdoor). Consider campus/off-campus drives – many big firms (TCS, Deloitte, EY, etc.) still run virtual hiring for 2025 graduates. Register for _graduate programs_ at MNCs (Goldman Sachs, Google, etc.) and check their India-specific recruitment pages. 
	- For smaller firms or startups, sites like Internshala or AngelList can help. Critically, leverage personal networks: alumni mentors, friends from college, or internship supervisors can provide referrals. Referred candidates often get interviews faster. If possible, attend industry webinars or virtual career fairs in consulting/analytics.
- **Certifications & Learning:** 
	- Bolster the resume with relevant certifications. For data roles, Google’s Data Analytics Certificate, IBM’s Data Science Professional Certificate, or a Tableau/PowerBI course signal readiness. 
	- For business analysis, consider IIBA’s ECBA or PMI-PBA (even basic courses) and mention them. The candidate has completed a Google Cloud fundamentals course, which is good; adding data-specific courses (SQL, Python for data, Excel) will make her stand out. 
	- In interviews, be ready to discuss any such certifications as evidence of continuous learning.
- **Preparation:** 
	- Practice “case interview” or structured problem-solving exercises (common in consulting interviews). Also prepare examples from past projects that show teamwork, initiative, and adaptability. 
	- Recruiters advise being ready to _“speak to anything on your resume”_ in detail. If transitioning to an analytics role, brush up on basic statistics and any domain (finance, marketing) relevant to the target industry.
