### Fuzzy Sets terminologies :
- <font color="#ffc000">Core :</font> The **core** of a fuzzy set 𝐴 is the set of all elements 𝑥 in the universe of discourse 𝑋 where the membership function 𝜇𝐴(𝑥) is equal to 1. In other words, it consists of all elements that fully belong to the fuzzy set.
- <font color="#ffc000">Support :</font> The **support** of a fuzzy set 𝐴 is the set of all elements 𝑥 in the universe of discourse 𝑋 where the membership function 𝜇𝐴(𝑥) is greater than 0. It includes all elements that have a non-zero degree of membership in the fuzzy set.
- <font color="#ffc000">Singleton Set :</font> A **singleton set** in the context of fuzzy sets is a fuzzy set where only one element has a non-zero membership value, and that value is typically 1.
- <font color="#ffc000">Band Width :</font> The **band width** of a fuzzy set refers to the range of values in the universe of discourse over which the membership function is non-zero. It essentially describes the spread or width of the fuzzy set.
- <font color="#ffc000">Cross-over Points :</font> **Cross-over points** are the values of 𝑥 in the universe of discourse where the membership function 𝜇𝐴(𝑥) is equal to 0.5. These points indicate where the membership grade of the fuzzy set transitions from being less than 0.5 to greater than 0.5, or vice versa.
- <font color="#ffc000">Convexity :</font> A fuzzy set 𝐴 is **convex** if for any two elements 𝑥1x and 𝑥2​ in the universe of discourse 𝑋, and for any 𝜆∈[0,1], the membership function satisfies :
	-> 𝜇𝐴 (𝜆𝑥1 + (1−𝜆) 𝑥2) *≥* min⁡(𝜇𝐴(𝑥1) , 𝜇𝐴(𝑥2)) 
	This means that the membership grade of any point between 𝑥1 and 𝑥2​ should not be less than the minimum membership grade of 𝑥1​ and 𝑥2.
- <font color="#ffc000">Normality :</font> A fuzzy set 𝐴 is **normal** if there is at least one element in the universe of discourse 𝑋 whose membership grade is 1. In other words, the maximum membership grade in the fuzzy set is 1.

### Consider the Following membership Functions: 
- A = { (x1, 0.3). (x2, 0.5), (x3,1), (x4,0.8),(x5,0.1) } 
- B = { (x1, 0.5). (x2, 0.2). (x3,0.7), (x4,0.4), (x5,0.6) }
- Perform the following Fuzzy Operations on these fuzzy sets:
	a. Algebraic sum [uA(x) + uB(x) - uA(x) * uB(x)]
	b. Algebraic difference [μA−B​(x) = max ( 0,μA​(x)−μB​(x) )]
	c. Bounded sum [uA(x) (+) uB(x) = min { 1, uA(x) + uB(x) }]
	d. Union [uAUB(x) = max { uA(x), uB(x) }]
	e. Algebraic product [uA.B(x) = uA(x) * uB(x )]
	f. Bounded difference [uA(x) (-) uB(x) = max { 1, uA(x) + uB(x) }]
	g. Cartesian product [uAxB(x,y) = min { uA(x), uB(x) }]
